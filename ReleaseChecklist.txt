Make sure to do all of this, each release! You could screw up, seriously!

1. Make sure OT_DB_VERSION and OSU_BUS_VERSION is set appropriately.
   (and make sure Info.plist agrees with OSU_BUS_VERSION!)

2. Make sure databases are properly regenerated.

   a. For each active, supported OT_DB_VERSION, (or just this version),
      run a compiled version of 'tripdb' on an old database from that version.
      This will update it.
   
   b. Open the database, and edit any new entries is 'pretty_names' table.
      That is, look for entries where both names are ALL CAPS!
   
   c. Upload all these new databases to the Cache Databases section of
      the OSU Bus website.
   
3. Tag and commit the current git repository. Useful for later branching!
   ( commit: `git commit [-a]`
     tag:    `git tag -a v0.0.0 -m "tagging version 0.0.0"`
     push:   `git push && git push --tags` [may take a while] )

### SUBMIT APP TO APP STORE / BUILD AD-HOC VERSION / WHATEVER ###
### (wait until approval, upload, whatever till you go on...) ###

3. Make sure to add an appropriate Version Bulletin on the web site!

Make sure to do all of this, each release! You could screw up, seriously!

1. Make sure OT_DB_VERSION and OSU_BUS_VERSION is set appropriately.
   (and make sure Info.plist agrees with OSU_BUS_VERSION!)

2. Make sure databases are properly regenerated.

   a. For each active, supported OT_DB_VERSION, run a compiled version of
      'tripdb' on an old database from that version. This will update it.
   
   b. Open the database, and edit any new entries is 'pretty_names' table.
      That is, look for entries where both names are ALL CAPS!
   
   c. Upload all these new databases (with different names!) to
      'updates/incoming/'.
   
   d. Inside 'updates/', run 'proccess.py'.

### SUBMIT APP TO APP STORE / BUILD AD-HOC VERSION / WHATEVER ###
### (wait until approval, upload, whatever till you go on...) ###

3. Make sure to update "updates/version" appropriately on the server!

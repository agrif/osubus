This is the Django-based backend behind <osubus.gamma-level.com>. It
handles the informational front pages, as well as the backend
application news and database updates. It is provided here so that the
source of OSU Bus is complete -- this website is part of a functioning
OSU Bus system. However, there should be very little reason to ever
run this site yourself.

To the best of my knowledge, this site needs these things to run:

 * Django
 * Python Markdown
 * Typogrify
 * Sqlite3

probably all at the latest version. There may be things I left out,
too. As mentioned before, this is not really packaged for mass
consumption :P.

can find useful gems in this morass of code, it's there to be used
(under the CC license, of course).

(Note that this is *different* than the license for OSU Bus itself:
OSU Bus is under the GNU GPL v2, while this code is under Creative
Commons by-nc-sa. I did this so the ENTIRE website (content included)
is under ONE license, not many.)
